NEW UPGRADE IDEAS

Unlock Abilities (Secondary Fire, Ability 1, Ability 2, Ultimate, ?Primary Fire?)[hero specific as to which upgrades appear for player]
    After Ability purchased, subsequent upgrades:
        Reduce Ability cooldown
        increase charges
        modify resource generation (is resource gen even worth dealing with?)

If primary fire is an upgrade for everybody, start all heroes with only melee enabled? XD

Increase Ammunition
    Exact increase based on a hero-specific modifier
    Disabled for heroes who don't use ammunition


BOSS IDEAS
(some of these might be a bit ambitious for the scope of the mode, we can dial things back if that ends up being the case)
