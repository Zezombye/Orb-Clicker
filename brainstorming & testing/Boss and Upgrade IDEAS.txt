Option C is meh because:
- players joining mid-game will have a ton of info and will be pressured to play immediately
- you have to rely on other players to heal you etc (and in a custom game that's a bad idea, assume your teammates are bronze level)

Option A is also meh:
- only max 6 players
- not really multiplayer, players will rarely be at the same boss (there is no ascension)

Option B actually seems to be the best
The key is to make an upgrade that grants you like 1% more money (compounding or not) every second you spend in the boss fight.
This encourages staying alive.
Could also do 1% more dmg every second you spend, so the boss is only beatable if you manage to survive more than X seconds

The problem remains as to how to deal with players joining mid-game who will be met with a ton of unlocked upgrades

Name: "infinity clicker"
OPM-like story where Moira has granted herself infinite power and is trying to find worthy rivals
The final boss (or second to last boss) grants opaf upgrades so you get like 1e9999999 money but it doesn't matter as it's nothing compared to infinity
The boss fight relies on avoiding damage then idk



NEW UPGRADE IDEAS

Unlock Abilities (Secondary Fire, Ability 1, Ability 2, Ultimate, ?Primary Fire?)[hero specific as to which upgrades appear for player]
    After Ability purchased, subsequent upgrades:
        Reduce Ability cooldown
        increase charges
        modify resource generation (is resource gen even worth dealing with?)

If primary fire is an upgrade for everybody, start all heroes with only melee enabled? XD

Increase Ammunition
    Exact increase based on a hero-specific modifier
    Disabled for heroes who don't use ammunition
