Fight all 32 heroes as bots
Each bot has its stats multiplied by 4-5 

- money * ult charge
- more health
- more dmg reduction
- critical chance + multiplier
- poison
- custom abilities to unlock
- extra life mechanic
- money * nb of letters in boss name
- cost scaled by -5%
- headshots ^2 instead of *2
- each crit has a chance to be a "super crit" where crit multiplier is squared
- money multiplied by the nb of boss souls
- dmg ^ current boss
- reduce scaling factor of hp
- individual dmg modifiers per ability
- perks
- damage multiplied by the amount of bullets not missed
- start with x% amount of poison dmg already dealt
- temporary dmg boost

- bot has too much hp, gotta push it into the void

- instantly go to next boss upon killing current boss?
- reset ult on going to spawn?
